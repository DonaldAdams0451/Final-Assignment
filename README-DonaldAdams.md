**TEAM MEMBERS:**
Donald Adams & Bryan Hernandez

**MODIFICATIONS:** *MAJOR* - Speed Boost + UI || *MINOR* - "Enemies Passed" Score
|| *(I worked on the MAJOR MOD: Speed Boost + UI Element)*

**CHALLENGES:**
Greatest Challenge was figuring out how to implement the speed boost recharge rate. Making sure the UI showed when the speed boost was available was also a bit tricky, but much less daunting than creating the recharge time for the speed boost.

**FUTURE CHANGES:**
I may tinker around with this project in my own time over the holiday break, but just for fun. || I would need to clean up the Boost Availability UI so it fades in using Alpha. I would also like to add in my own 3D models within the scene.
