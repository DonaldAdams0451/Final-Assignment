**TEAM MEMBERS:**
Donald Adams & Bryan Hernandez

**MODIFICATIONS:** *MAJOR* - Speed Boost + UI || *MINOR* - "Enemies Passed" Score
|| *(I worked on the MINOR* - "Enemies Passed" Score Element)*

**CHALLENGES:**
I think my biggest challenge was figuring out how to make the high score save the highest scoring session in the game. Coding the elements such as the light and particle colliders and the score functions in the UI weren't half bad, but figuring out how to code properly a properly a high score feature was definitely a big hurdle for me to overcome. 

**FUTURE CHANGES:**
In the future, I want to add a ticking timer to the UI and overall game. That way, an added fear element could be added alongside further expanding the high score feature in seeing who could get the most points in the shortest amount of time.
